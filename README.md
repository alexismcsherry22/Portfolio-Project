# Portfolio-Project

The purpose of this project is to build a portfolio website that will tell people who you are and what you do, and to display and demonstrate the projects and skills learned during the course.

The requirements of building this website was using what was learned in both HTML and SCSS during the first two weeks and build the website from scratch using that knowledge and any other skills you may have learned previously or something new to try out.

Apart from the website it was also to become familiar with using git via command lines (git bash). While I only used the main branch for this project (due to forgeting about the practice of branches), I am very familiar with the usefulness (and pain) of using branches (espically in a team project).

To briefly outline the design of the pages, I kept the landing/home, about, and contact pages in a very simple style which is just style wraping on the text and images.

The project's page is a little more complicated as each project is seperated as its own section that has an image, a header (project title), a brief description of the project, and a link to both the website and the project repository.

The skills page is a bit more complicated than the other pages as it uses javascript to not only help with in-page view by ultilsing a grid of buttons. Those buttons are a list of skills that when pressed moves the page view to the bottom of the page where a description and example of that skill will be displayed.
