# Portfolio-Project

## Project Outline

The purpose of this project is to build a portfolio website that will tell people who you are and what you do, and to display and demonstrate the projects and skills learned during the course.

## Project Requirements

The requirements of building this website was using what was learned in both HTML and SCSS during the first two weeks and build the website from scratch using that knowledge and any other skills you may have learned previously or something new to try out.

## Learning Outcomes

Apart from the website it was also to become familiar with using git via command lines (git bash). While I only used the main branch for this project (due to forgetting about the practice of branches), I am very familiar with the usefulness (and pain) of using branches (especially in a team project).

## Styling / Design

To briefly outline the design of the pages, I kept the landing/home, about, and contact pages in a very simple style which is just style wrapping on the text and images. All pages and its elements scale with screen size.

## How to use the Project

This project uses HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. Does not require any extensions to run.

## Extensions

The Extensions used to build this project are:

-   Live Server by Ritwick Dey
-   SASS package

## Pages

### Project's Page

The project's page is a little more complicated as each project is separated as its own section that has an image, a header (project title), a brief description of the project, and a link to both the website and the project repository.

### Skill's Page

The skill's page is a bit more complicated than the other pages as it uses JavaScript to not only help with in-page view by utilizing a grid of buttons. Those buttons are a list of skills that when pressed moves the page view to the bottom of the page where a description and example of that skill will be displayed.

### Landing Page

The landing page is a very basic page that just includes the nav bar and some large text that is set as a very brief introduction.

### About Page

The about page provides an image and text that will provide a simple showcase about who am I, what I do, what are my passions and what I look like.

### Contacts Page

The contacts' page lists some ways you can contact me and preview my work in text.
