        The Task of the Ecommerce Shop Project was to create a website that had its data stored in a firestore firebase (database) built using React (combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript known as JSX). The Project required three pages, a page of products that displayed a carousel of featured products and a grid of all the products available from the "shop". Another page titled the product page which individually displayed an item and all of its information, and lastly a cart page that displayed the items a user had added to their cart. The side goal of the project was to understand how and when to use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with an application.

      <p class="project__section--para">
        The Task of the Wordle Project was to create a basic version of Wordle using Java and using the console as its interactive interface. The goal of the project was to have a user that has 6 attempts to guess the secret word and give that user an output that describes how close their guess was to the secret word. For example, telling the user if they found a letter that's in the correct position, telling the user they found a correct letter but it's in the wrong position, telling the user if they failed to guess the word, and telling the user they have guessed the world correctly.
